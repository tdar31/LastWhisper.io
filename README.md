To-do

- Swap to single color schema
- Build out and parse rest of match history data returned from account API call
- Buy domain (done)
- Have region be linked to part of the query so you can toggle (done)
- Relink MongoDB and setup model structure
- Swapping font to a local import

/////////

- Parsing match data

ParticipantIdentites -> arr -> player.accountId = accountId -> finds specific player and returns participantId

participants[i].stats.participantId

-> stats
    - win
    - spell1Id
    - spell2Id
    - item1 through item6
    - kills
    - deaths
    - assists
    - champLevel
    - role

//////////

Home Page -> search -> API call for basic info (done) -> checks account Id against cached accountId's in DB

if found -> return existing save profile data and match history and populate profile page -> Only update if update button is hit

if not found -> 2nd API call using accountId to search for match data -> create new profile with account data + match history as push to mongoDB -> return new profile and populate profile page

when update button is hit repeat 'if not found' but overwrite existing profile with newly returned data

- All api calls have to match region searched
- Input sanitization needs to be setup (Riot has restrictios on usernames but still should have something)
- Remove mulitple themes and just go with one (red)
